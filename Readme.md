# FastBlocks*

(\* *temporary title*)

FastBlocks is a project to reinvent a nice LAN Party Tetrominos game like Tetrinet once was.

I'm using this as a basis to learn JavaFX and be able to prototype simple game ideas.

## Technical information

This project runs on Java 11. You can download one from [Adopt OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot).

## Roadmap

### What's currently in the game ?

(spoilers: not much)

* Full pieces physics with support for wall-kicks

* Basic line-clearing (no gravity)

* Support for sound effects

### What's planned 

* Line counting

* Additional visual effects

* Special blocks

* Event log

* Multiplayer

* Editable configuration

And more...

## Credits 

Sounds effects are public domain sound effects from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) with their original file names.
